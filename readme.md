Here I put different exercises that I am solving.

The objective is always to approach them on the TDD, with a development based on the tests.

If you came here to see how I am coding, I leave you my top 4 projects:

    1. almostIncreasingSequence
    
    2. commonCharacterCount
    
    3. matrixElementsSum
    
    4. encryption
